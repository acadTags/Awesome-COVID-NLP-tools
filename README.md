# Awesome-COVID-NLP-tools
This is a curation of a list of COVID-19 related NLP tools that might be interested to both researchers in COVID-19 and also in the clinical NLP domain.

For a list of search engines or information retrieval tools using the CORD-19 dataset. See a summary of them in Table 2 in the paper [CORD-19: The COVID-19 Open Research Dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10706.pdf).

LitCOVID. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/. By the Computational Biology Branch, NCBI/NLM. A "a curated literature hub for tracking up-to-date scientific information about the 2019 novel Coronavirus. It is the most comprehensive resource on the subject, providing a central access to 51785 (and growing) relevant articles in PubMed. The articles are updated daily and are further categorized by different research topics and geographic locations for improved access."
